# space-shooter

This is a simple 2D shooter that I made using JavaScript and HTML. I created the
images myself using pixilart.com while the audio files were taken from several
users on freesound.org.

To play the game you can clone/download the repository and open
.../space-shooter/index.html in your browser.

In Google Chrome you can open a file with Control + O (Command + O for Mac OS X
users).

## Gameplay

W - Move Up

A - Move Left

S - Move Down

D - Move Right

Enter - Fire

The alien waves keep increase as the game moves on until it reaches a rate of 10
per second. The aliens themselves will speed up the more you dodge them so it's
best to destroy them right away. The asteroids will spawn in randomly but you
can also destroy the aliens so you can use them for cover. 

The game ends when you die but make sure to take as many of those alien bastards
down as you can. :rage2:
